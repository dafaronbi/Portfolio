           <p>Rayz explores the relationship between music, programming, and midi controllers.
             It uses playstation move controllers to create a variety of both prerecorded sounds as
             well as simple oscillators using the ChucK , a programming language for real-time sound synthesis.
             The four different sections of the piece focus on different choreographed movements and the sonic result,
             with improvisation also being an important aspect for the performance.

                  <img width="560" height="300" src="img/audio.jpg" >
                  <p>Synthesizers have been an essential tool for composers of any style of music including computer
                  generated sound. They allow for an expansion in timbral variety to the orchestration of a piece of
                  music or sound scape. Sound designers are trained to be able to recreate a timbre in their head
                  using a synthesizer. This works well for simple sounds but becomes more difficult as the number
                  of parameters required to produce a specific timbre increase. The goal of this research project is
                  to build a cross modal retrieval system that can retrieve correct synthesizer parameter vector given an audio signal
                  representation.</p>

                <p>AFRINUM aims at renewing the discourse about innovation in Western African societies through the lens of the popular music industry. We consider digital technology

                  contributes to transforming, producing or reifying. This project is done as part of <a href="http://www.leilaadu.com/">Dr. Leila Adu Gilmore's</a> <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/criticalsonicpracticelab/">Critical Sonic Practice Lab</a></p>

                  <p>The objective of this project was to give students real world experience with building a microprocessor system.
                    The microprocessor system is based on Intel's 8051 microcontroller and performs a variety of memory functions to read, edit, move, and find
                    contents in ram. It also interfaces with a variety of IO devices such as an LCD display, a real time clock, a seven

                  <p>The Wi-Fi Synthesizer project was conceptualized as a device to read midi input and generate audio waveforms based on the information provided by the midi signal.
                     The device would also transfer the midi signal received via Wi-Fi to a website by a http request. The midi component of the project was not included in the final
                     application because of time restraints, but the circuitry was still included in the design. The final application outputs a 100hz audio signal with a user selected
                     wave shape (selected from four options). The device will send data to a website indicating which waveform was last selected.</p>
